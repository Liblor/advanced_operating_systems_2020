\begin{abstract}
This lab project introduces an \acs{ahci} driver and associated \acs{ata}
primitives to Barrelfish\footnote{\url{http://www.barrelfish.org}}. Interfacing
disks is implemented in a library that communicates with a management service.
To enable integration of multiple controllers offering access to
\acs{ata}/\acs{atapi}-based devices, Flounder modifications including a backend
for \acs{ahci} are proposed. This project also provides a basic analysis of the
driver's performance characteristics. To demonstrate usage, a simple testcase,
a FAT filesystem implementation and a simple block device filesystem are
introduced.
